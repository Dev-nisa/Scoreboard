This is a Scrimba Front End Developer project to create a scoreboard. The point of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of using Flexbox and functions in JavaScript. Each project has a bare minimum, but Scrimba suggests stretch goals. There were 3 stretch goals: 
  1. Add quarters or periods to scoreboard
  2. Add a reset button
  3. Add a timer
I chose the first couple of goals because I needed more time to research how to code a timer. My calendar is marked to add a timer, make the style unique, and to make a toggle for different sports scoreboards.

Some things I learned from this project:
  - The most interesting part was checking out different fonts. I learned how to add Google fonts to the CSS and where to find unsafe Google fonts.
  - Nailing down how flexbox works, especially when using rows VS. columns. The most helpful search brought me to gap: #px.
  - When it came to coding the JavaScript, it took a couple tried to figure out the best order to execute functions.
